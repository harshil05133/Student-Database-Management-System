# Student Database Management System (AVL Tree) 🏫🌳

**Overview** 

This project is a high-performance student database management system implemented in C++ using an AVL Tree. It efficiently stores, retrieves, and manages student records based on UFID and name, ensuring fast lookups and modifications even for large datasets.

**Features** 

✅ Self-balancing AVL Tree for efficient storage and retrieval
✅ Fast insert, delete, search, and update operations (O(log n) time complexity)
✅ Supports thousands of student records with automatic balancing
✅ Customizable for real-world applications like student databases, registration systems, and ID-based searches

**How It Works** 

• Each student record is stored as a node in the AVL tree.

• The tree maintains balance through rotations after insertions and deletions.

• Supports various queries, such as searching by UFID, listing students alphabetically, and more.


**Use Cases**  

📌 University student databases for managing large student lists efficiently
📌 Online registration systems where fast ID-based lookups are crucial
📌 Any application requiring fast, ordered data retrieval and updates

**Technologies Used** 

- C++ for implementation
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Data Structures & Algorithms (AVL Trees, Balancing, Rotations)
  
**Installation & Usage** 

1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/harshil05133/AVL-Student-Database.git

cd AVL-Student-Database

3. Compile the program: 
g++ main.cpp -o student_db

4. Run the program:
./student_db
